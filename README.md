# HackRice 15 Starter Code

Welcome to the HackRice 15 starter code! This repository is designed to give you a head start in building your project, providing a solid foundation for both your backend and frontend development.

## Philosophy

This starter code is intentionally minimal. We believe in learning by doing, and that includes the freedom to experiment, make mistakes, and find the best solutions for your unique project. Don't be afraid to break things, try new libraries, or restructure the code to fit your needs. The best way to learn is through trial and error.

## Collaboration and Communication

Successful projects are built on strong communication. We encourage you to work closely with your teammates. Frontend and backend engineers should maintain a shared understanding of each other's progress, challenges, and ideas. If you have a product manager, keep them in the loop. Frequent, open communication is key to a smooth and effective development process.

### Working with GenAI

Generative AI tools can be powerful collaborators. Feel free to use them to brainstorm ideas, generate boilerplate code, or debug issues. However, use them wisely. Always review and understand the code they produce, and ensure it aligns with your project's goals and quality standards. Treat AI as a helpful assistant, not a replacement for your own critical thinking.
