# HackRice 15 Starter Code & Project Description

We are a three person HackRice team comprised of Rice University freshman students studying Computer Science. Much of our team hails from Seattle, Washington hence our team name: SeattleOwls. This is our first university hackathon! To aid us in our hacking, we've pulled much of our code from the HackRice 15 starter code! The repository was designed to give us a head start in building our project, providing a solid foundation for both our backend and frontend development.

For our hack, we've chosen to create a app that, when given the name, expiration date, frequency and amount of each dose of a particular medicine, will alert and remind the patient to take their medicine on time and before the expiration date. Many members on our HackRice team have experienced the pain of forgetting to take a prescribed medicine. The patient shouldn't have to worry about expiration dates, dosage, and when to take a specific medicine. Their goal should be to recover as quickly as possible. Hence, our hack aims to address this particular issue.

**Patients taking multiple medications for a wide range of conditions (diseases, allergies, etc.) need a way to effectively keep track of drug experiation dates, dosages, and when to take each specific medication because 50% of patients do not take their medications as prescribed.** This leads to certain medications never fulfilling their full benefits, which can prevent a patient from properly recovering. These statistics are from a study from the [National Library of Medicine](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3068890/).

## Philosophy

The starter code is intentionally minimal. HackRice15 believes in learning by doing, and that includes the freedom to experiment, make mistakes, and find the best solutions for our unique project. We aren't afraid to break things, try new libraries, or restructure the code to fit our needs. The best way to learn is through trial and error.

## Collaboration and Communication

Successful projects are built on strong communication. Hence, it is a standard practice to work closely with our teammates. Throuhgout our project, each of our frontend and backend engineers maintained a shared understanding of each other's progress, challenges, and ideas through direct communication, pull-requests, and the general structure of our GitHub repository. This way, everyone was kept in the loop. Frequent, open communication is key to a smooth and effective development process.

### Working with GenAI

Generative AI tools can be powerful collaborators. We are encouraged and free to use them to brainstorm ideas, generate boilerplate code, or debug issues. However, as wise hackers, we use them wisely. Since this was our first hackathon, we definitely utilized generative AI tools for brainstorming and other tasks along our hacking process. A general pointer is to always review and understand the code they produce, and ensure it aligns with our project's goals and quality standards. Treat AI as a helpful assistant, not a replacement for our own critical thinking.

## Useful Resources

Here are some resources that we may find helpful for design patterns and inspiration:

## Getting Started

To dive into the specifics of the starter code, please refer to the `README.md` files within the following directories:

*   `./backend/`: For details on the backend setup, API structure, and database models.
*   `./frontend/`: For information on the frontend framework and how to get started with the user interface.

Happy hacking!
